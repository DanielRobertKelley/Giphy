Giphy Homework assignment
This Home Work assignment was designed to interact with the Giphy APi. We were to choose a topic of our liking(music bands) and make the pictures interact with the user. I have created a few pre-made buttons in which the user is able to click on and generate 10 giphy pictures. Also with these pictures you have the ability to stop and start the Gif by clicking on the image. There is also a user add buttom, where the user is able to add any band they want, and have their giphy generated. 

For this HW you need to sign up for a GIPHy account to make generate your own API and APIkey
for this page I used API,AJAX,JQUERY,JS
